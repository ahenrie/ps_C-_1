| long long int          | 8               | -(2^63) to (2^63)-1                             |
| unsigned long long int | 8               | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615                |
| signed char            | 1               | -128 to 127                                     |
| unsigned char          | 1               | 0 to 255                                        |
| float                  | 4               | -3.4×10^38 to 3.4×10^38                         |
| double                 | 8               | -1.7×10^308 to 1.7×10^308                       |

| wchar_t                | 2 or 4          | 1 wide character                                |

**Advantages:**

1. Data types offer a systematic approach to classifying and structuring data within a program, enhancing comprehensibility and manageability.
2. Each data type possesses a distinct range of acceptable values, providing precise control over the nature of stored data.
3. Data types act as safeguards, minimizing errors and glitches by imposing stringent regulations on data manipulation and utilization.
4. C++ boasts a comprehensive assortment of data types, granting developers the flexibility to select the optimal type for a given task.

**Disadvantages:**

1. Selecting an inappropriate data type can lead to unexpected outcomes and programming errors.
2. Certain data types, like long doubles or char arrays, can consume substantial memory space, potentially affecting performance if utilized excessively.
3. C++'s intricate type system might pose challenges for novices, hindering their ability to grasp and proficiently apply the language.
4. Integrating data types can introduce added intricacy and verbosity to a program, possibly compromising its readability and clarity.
